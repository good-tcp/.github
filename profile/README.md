# GTCP
The simple, and secure TCP framework

GTCP aims to provide the best developer experience in of the most frustrating subjects: TCP.
- Event Based Messaging: Intuitive and readable, no one wants to spend more focus on reading code than understanding it.
- Automatic RSA encryption for every message: Security doesn't have to be a hassle.
- Consistent Cross Language Support: Who likes having to learn a completely different system for every language?
- Callback Functions: No. One. Likes. Promises.
